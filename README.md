You can change the placeholder arguments with any other argument you want to test the function with. Similarly you can change the flag to test some other function.
<br><br>
Keep in mind each question has it's own flag and number of arguments required to be passed.
<br><br>
For example for executing the first question of the Python test, you can execute the following:
```
python3 py_test.py --gen 102030 3
```
